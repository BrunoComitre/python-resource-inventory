## What is Python

Below is a list of favorite sites that have a variety of topics related to Python Language in general:

Tools link to learn: [developer script](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap)

Guide: [Guide: How to contribute to Open Source](https://willianjusten.com.br/guia-como-contribuir-em-open-source/)

Skills: [Developer Survey Results
2019](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#top-paying-technologies)

Books: [The 25 most recommended programming books of all-time](https://dev.to/daolf/the-25-most-recommended-programming-books-of-all-time-5fel)

Open-Source: [How to contribute to an open-source project without writing any code](https://leportella.com/english/2018/03/20/how-to-contribute-to-open-source.html)

Open-Source Libraries: [34 Amazing Python Open Source Libraries for the Past Year (v.2019)](https://medium.mybridge.co/34-amazing-python-open-source-libraries-for-the-past-year-v-2019-93d6ee11aceb)

[10 Extraordinary GitHub Repos for All Developers](https://medium.com/better-programming/10-extraordinary-github-repos-for-all-developers-939cdeb28ad0)

**First**

Learn Python:

You don't need to know Python in PRO mode, for example, but to enter this world you need certain basic knowledge:

- Don't you know Python? I highly recommend Gustavo Guanabara from [Video Course | Curso em Vídeo](https://www.cursoemvideo.com/course/curso-python-3/)

- All about Python [Real Python](https://realpython.com/)

Frameworks Python: Falcon, Starlette (fastapi), Quart, Python on Wheels, weppy, morepath.

**Second**

Prepare the PC:

I suggest Anaconda Navigator for those who are starting their studies in this field. It is Open Source for the programming languages Python and R. And it has all the necessary tools.

- Python can be downloaded via the Anaconda distribution: [Download Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)

- You can now also use an IDE. Recommended:
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - [Atom](https://atom.io/)

**Valuable Tips**

Below are some tips for you to go on your way:

1. Know the trail made by Leonardo Ferreira who in 1 year and a half became a data scientist and is in the 30th position as a data scientist [Kaggle](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/data-science- from-zero-kaggle-kernel-master-leonardo-ferreira /).
2. Organize your studies and don't mix or try to absorb many of the teachings.
3. Have profiles on Linkedin, GitHub, Kaggle and Hacker Rank. Have a Twitter developer account for text mining.
4. Go deeper by drinking teaching from various sources! example: when studying Python, read e-books and several other materials from different sources because each course has a different didactic and if you "pack" in some ok subject, it is common: look for other didactics until you understand.
5. If you want and can, invest in paid courses and specializations.
6. Use and learn with concept maps.

**Kind of obligatorily, understand:**

- Statistics.
- Univariate analysis.
- Bivariate analysis.
- Qualitative and Quantitative Variables.
- Basic mathematical requirements ..
- Notions of analytical and numerical optimization.
- Discover tools for data extraction on the web.
- Basics of linear algebra, eigenvectors, eigenvalues, base changes, among others.
- It is worth knowing the least about: Amazon AWS server and Amazon QuickSight and Microsoft Power BI.
- And also: version control, markdown, git, GitHub.

Like anything you want to learn, you should get involved with it, and a tip is always don't try to understand everything at once, take it easy. Frequent communities. The Python community in Brazil is one of the strongest and most active I have ever seen.

And that's it: this is the Area's Introductory Package. You are now able to start experimenting with the area.

**Comments:**

- The above script is not the only and not necessarily the best way to learn; it reflects what I intend to acquire as knowledge and I have noted it in meetings and lectures and conversations in my trajectory in the area.

### Linters

Aimed at discovering the best linting tools for Python:

Used based on the Lecture: [Python Brasil 13 - Preventing Headaches with Linters and Automatic Checks - Vinta Software](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kH7Mo9Z9u4)

<br />

**Linters:**

- Bugs: [pylint](https://pypi.org/project/pylint/)
- Security Vulnerabilities: [bandit](https://pypi.org/project/bandit/), [dodgy](https://pypi.org/project/dodgy/), [pyt](https://pypi.org/project/pyt/), [hacking](https://pypi.org/project/hacking/), [safety](https://pypi.org/project/safety/), [dependency-check](https://pypi.org/project/dependency-check/)
- Bad Quality and Patterns: [flake8](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/), [flake8-bugbear](https://pypi.org/project/flake8-bugbear/), [pydiatra](https://pypi.org/project/pydiatra/), [vulture](https://pypi.org/project/vulture/)
- Imports: [isort](https://pypi.org/project/isort/), [pycycle](https://pypi.org/project/pycycle/)
- Incorrect Documentation and Formatting: [pydocstyle](https://pypi.org/project/pydocstyle/)
- Packaging: [pyroma](https://pypi.org/project/pyroma/), [check-manifest](https://pypi.org/project/check-manifest/)
- Cpython: [cpychecker](https://emptysqua.re/blog/analyzing-python-c-extensions-with-cpychecker/)
- Orthography: [scspell3k](https://pypi.org/project/scspell3k/)
- Typing: [mypy](https://pypi.org/project/mypy/)
- Bot Github: [linty-fresh](https://pypi.org/project/linty-fresh/))

Combine all using: [prospector](https://prospector.landscape.io/en/master/) or [coala](https://coala.io/#/home?lang=Python) or [black](https://github.com/psf/black)

<br />

**Notes:**

- Studying AST — [Abstract Syntax Trees](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html) [pyflakes](https://pypi.org/project/pyflakes/)

- Inference-based AST check — [pylint](https://pypi.org/project/pylint/) thanks to lib [astroid](https://pypi.org/project/astroid/)

<br />

**When to run linters?**

  1. Moment of implementation
  2. Commit moment [pre-commit.com](https://pre-commit.com/)
  3. Moment of continuous integration
  4. Moment of code review

<br />

**Search:**

Find, install and publish Python packages with the Python package index via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/)

## Notes

Space to add Python Language notes:

```
ASYNCIO

async / await -> create an object of type coroutine

to execute a coroutine it is necessary to pass it into asyncio.run() (eventloop?)

task -> asyncio.create_task() executes the concurrent coroutines

awaitables -> There are three main types of awaitalbes objects: corountines, tasks and futures

coroutines -> can be awaited from other coroutines

tasks -> are used to schedule coroutines concurrently

futures -> is a low-level awaitable that represents an eventual result of an asynchronous operation.
```
